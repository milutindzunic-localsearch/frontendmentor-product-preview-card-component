### What I learned

This challenge was pretty straightforward for me, after finishing a couple of similar "card-style" ones.
After finishing my solution, I saw that there might be a nicer way to deal with responsive images, using the picture tag and source sets, instead of using utility classes to hide them based on the viewport width. So, I'll be sure to use this the next time I need a similar functionality!
